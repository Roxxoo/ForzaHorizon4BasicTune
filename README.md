# ForzaHorizon4BasicTune
Just a basic tuning calculator with a few notes about some common problems with under steer, over steer and grip loss. Can only be used with the tuning tabs: Anti-roll bars, Springs and Dampening tabs.

The guide that I used to make this application is this YouTube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM7_3NGGUoQ
It was made by a user named HokiHoshi - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8GztlirjJ3ScRqpufo3PRQ

This application also used tkinter for the GUI. This project was made in Python.
